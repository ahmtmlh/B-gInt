# BigInt
A partially functional Big Integer library that uses only strings to create to find big factorials. 

# Warning
Substraction and division operations is not available by the current implementation. This code was created for big factorial  values in mind. Any addition and multiplication would work. However, this was for the applications that can't benefit from Big Integer classes provided by Java.
